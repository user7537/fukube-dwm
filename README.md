# Fukube DWM
Fukube is the hostname of the system that I use for everything including my work as a CS student.
This is a minimal setup using mostly suckless utilities that can do basically everything I want it to.

I highly doubt anyone is going to seriously use any of this, but i did spend over 2 weeks on this, so here you go.
Feel free to do whatever you want with it.
Im also going to create a github.io page on this as well, but im too tired for that rn.

Thanks for viewing this!
