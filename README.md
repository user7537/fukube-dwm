Fukube is the hostname of the system that I use for everything including my work as a CS student. (My phone's hostname is Mayaka)
This is a minimal setup using mostly suckless utilities that can do basically everything I want it to.

I have an old Dell Laptop with around 3.2 gigs of usable RAM and about 256 gigs for storage, and I needed something that was VERY minimal and thats how I came to create this.
This is highly inspired by as you might be able to guess, [BreadOnPenguins](https://github.com/BreadOnPenguins) and [Sylvan Franklin](https://github.com/SylvanFranklin)'s workflow and neovim setups respectively.
I highly doubt anyone is going to seriously use any of this, but i did spend months on this, so here you go.
Feel free to do whatever you want with it.
Im also going to create a github.io page on this as well, so look forward to it ^_^

Thanks for viewing this!
